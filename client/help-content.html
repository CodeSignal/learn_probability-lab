  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p><strong>CodeSignal Probability Lab</strong> is a simulation engine for repeated trials (coin, die, spinner, or custom devices) that helps you <strong>see probability stabilize</strong>: as you run more trials, the <strong>relative frequencies</strong> tend to settle near the theoretical probabilities.</p>
  <p>You’ll use live charts and tables to connect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sample space</strong> (all possible outcomes)</li>
    <li><strong>Event</strong> (a subset of outcomes)</li>
    <li><strong>Theoretical probability</strong> (what “should” happen in the long run)</li>
    <li><strong>Experimental probability</strong> (what your data shows)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Competencies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify probability as a measure of likelihood</li>
    <li>Describe outcomes and sample spaces</li>
    <li>Estimate event frequency from real or simulated data</li>
    <li>Compare probabilities</li>
    <li>Interpret relationships between events using tables or diagrams</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Define Event E</strong> by selecting outcomes (e.g., “Heads”, or “Even” by selecting 2, 4, 6).</li>
    <li><strong>Run trials</strong> using <em>Run</em>, the +1/+10/+100/+1000 buttons, or <em>Start auto</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpret the results</strong> using the charts and tables (look at how the estimates stabilize as trials increase).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>

  <h3>Relative Frequency (Bar)</h3>
  <p>Shows the current relative frequency of each outcome. The more trials you run, the more stable the bars become.</p>

  <h3>Convergence (Event E)</h3>
  <p>Tracks your estimate of <strong>P(E)</strong> over time. Early results fluctuate a lot; larger sample sizes tend to “settle.”</p>

  <h3>Frequency Table</h3>
  <p>Lists theoretical probability, count, relative frequency, and the difference (<strong>Δ</strong>) between experiment and theory for each outcome. Selected outcomes (Event E) are highlighted.</p>

  <h3>Two Events: Heatmap + Two-way Table</h3>
  <p>Click a cell in the heatmap to see:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>P(A ∩ B)</strong> (joint probability estimate)</li>
    <li><strong>P(A | B)</strong> and <strong>P(B | A)</strong> (conditional probability estimate)</li>
    <li>An "independence check" comparing <strong>P(A)·P(B)</strong> to <strong>P(A ∩ B)</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Troubleshooting / FAQ</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Why doesn’t my experimental probability equal the theoretical probability?</summary>
    <p>Because randomness has variance. With small samples, fluctuations are expected. As you run more trials, relative frequencies tend to stabilize near the theoretical values.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What does “convergence” mean here?</summary>
    <p>It means the estimate (relative frequency) becomes more stable as the number of trials increases. It won’t be perfectly constant, but the wiggles usually shrink.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What’s the point of a “biased” coin/die/spinner?</summary>
    <p>To compare probabilities and see how changing the underlying distribution changes the long-run frequencies. Predict first, then test.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How does “Dependent” work with custom devices?</summary>
    <p>Dependent mode splits outcomes into a “low half” and “high half” by their order. If you want the dependence to feel meaningful, order outcomes from low → high.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What should I look for in the two-way table?</summary>
    <p>Start with the joint counts. Then click a cell to compare <strong>P(A ∩ B)</strong> to <strong>P(A)·P(B)</strong>. If events are independent, these values should be close (with enough trials).</p>
